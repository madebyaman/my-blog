Hello, my name is Aman Thakur.

I am a frontend web developer by choice and still exploring it.  
I've always been fascinated by the technology and embraced every new change it brought with it. When I was a kid, I used to spend hours in Internet cafe to browse internet and computer.  
Now that, I've my own laptop I still spend hours in front of its screen learning programming and solving problems.
